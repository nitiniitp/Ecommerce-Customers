# Ecommerce-Customers
Here, I used Ecommerce Customers.csv from Kaggle and I used supervised machine learning (Linear Regression) to advise a (fake) ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
I explore this data, before using Linear Regression to study the correlations between the different factors and how they affect the how much the customer spends. Please find steps which I followed
Steps:
1. Imports
2. Data Exploration
3. Use Seaborn to plot some graphs to compare the relationships between the columns.
4. Also construct a heatmap of these correlations.
5. Splitting the Data
6. Training the Model
7. Predicting the Model
8. Evaluating the Model
9. Conclusions
